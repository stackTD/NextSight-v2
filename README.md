## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam or compatible camera device

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
- PyQt6 6.7.1 - Modern GUI framework
- OpenCV 4.10.0 - Computer vision library
- MediaPipe 0.10.14 - Hand detection ML models
- NumPy 1.26.4 - Numerical computing
- Pillow 10.4.0 - Image processing
- PyInstaller 6.11.1 - Standalone executable builder

## Building Standalone Executable

### Overview
NextSight v2 can be built into a standalone executable file that doesn't require Python installation on the target machine. This is perfect for distribution and deployment.

### Quick Build

#### Windows
```batch
build.bat
```

#### Cross-Platform (Linux, macOS, Windows with Git Bash)
```bash
./build.sh
```

### Manual Build Process
If you prefer to build manually:

1. **Install Build Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Build Executable**
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --clean nextsight.spec
   ```

3. **Locate Output**
   The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory:
   - Windows: `dist/NextSight-v2.exe`
   - Linux/macOS: `dist/NextSight-v2`

### Build Configuration
The build process is configured via `nextsight.spec` which includes:
- Single-file executable generation
- All necessary dependencies bundled
- Optimized for distribution (UPX compression)
- Windows version information metadata
- Proper handling of MediaPipe and OpenCV data files

### Build Output
- **File Size**: ~275-300 MB (includes all dependencies)
- **Architecture**: Matches build platform (x64 recommended)
- **Dependencies**: All Python libraries and Qt frameworks included
- **Standalone**: No Python installation required on target system

## Usage

### Run the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

### Controls
- **Detection Toggle**: Enable/disable hand detection
- **Landmarks**: Show/hide hand landmark points
- **Connections**: Show/hide connection lines between landmarks
- **Confidence Slider**: Adjust detection sensitivity
- **Camera Switch**: Toggle between available cameras

### Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_phase1.py
```

Generate a visual demonstration:
```bash
python demo_screenshot.py
```
