# MediaPipe PyInstaller Fix - Test Results

This directory contains test scripts used to verify the MediaPipe dependency fix for PyInstaller.

## Test Files

- `test_mediapipe_import.py` - Comprehensive test of MediaPipe imports and dependencies
- `test_mediapipe_fix.py` - Focused test for the specific matplotlib/MediaPipe issue  
- `test_executable_imports.py` - Test for built executable imports
- `test_executable_simple.py` - Simple executable test script
- `test_final_verification.py` - Full import chain verification
- `test_fix_verification.py` - Test that demonstrates the fix

## Issue Fixed

The original issue was:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'
```

This occurred because:
1. MediaPipe requires matplotlib as a dependency
2. PyInstaller spec file had matplotlib in the excludes list
3. MediaPipe dependencies were not fully included in hidden imports

## Solution Applied

1. **Updated requirements.txt** with all MediaPipe dependencies
2. **Fixed nextsight.spec** to include matplotlib and comprehensive hidden imports
3. **Added MediaPipe model files** to the build data
4. **Verified the fix** with comprehensive tests

## Test Results

All tests pass - the MediaPipe/matplotlib dependency issue is completely resolved.
